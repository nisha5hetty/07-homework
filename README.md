 Automatic scraper

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about scraping data from a website and creating an automatic scraper that would email you the changes in the scraped data.

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt how to do a scheduled scraper and learnt about cron, a time-based task scheduler, in the process. By the end of it, I learnt what each of the five time-and-date fields meant. It was quite neat! I also figured out how to have the scraped data sent to me via email...eventually.

## **Something I found challenging:**
SendGrid! My scrapes failed initially because SendGrid wanted me to verify a sender. Which was weird because some people said they didn't have to do that at all. This wasn't mentioned in class either. SendGrid wanted me to submit both the email address and the business address of the sender. I don't know why that's necessary to send an email. Once I did that, everything worked. Still not the biggest fan of SendGrid, though.
